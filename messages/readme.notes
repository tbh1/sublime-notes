---- Quick Start Guide -----

Notes is a simple and easy-to-use language for taking every-day notes.
To enable, either set syntax to Notes or save as a .notes file.
The language was designed to follow normal note taking behavior.
The main advantage of .notes is its syntax support for 30+ major languages!

Below are the core concepts of the Notes language

Headers:
- as the line above, any first-level text ending in a colon

Titles:
- Separate sections of notes via dashes
----------- Inline Title ------------

-----------------------------------------
 			Block Title
-----------------------------------------

Unordered Lists:
- Either dashes
. or periods
	- Supports nesting

Ordered Lists:
1. same as unordered, but numbered
2. like this
	a. or lettered
	i. including roman numerals
	ii. like this
3) just follow number/letter with . ) or both
4. mix and match ordered and unordered lists
	- like this
	a. and this

Highlights:
	# can be full line
	or #inline# as you please

Emphasis:
	- surround with <carrots>
	- or with *astrisks*
	- !! use bangs for super-important things
		- full line (above), and !!inline!! as well
URLS:
	- urls are highlighted, and right click to open
	- www.example.com, or with protocols: pop3://www.example.com

Vocabulary:
	- word: its definition
Arrows:
	- Usefule for showing flow
	- like this --> or => this, or <--- this

Code Snippets:
	- This is the best part of .notes!
	- simply surround code snippets with [language_name or file extension] and [end]

[js]
	(function (a, b) {
		return {of.all = {major: 'languages'}};
	})(alpha, beta);
[end]

[html]
	<h1 style="font-size:2em;">and inline syntax highlighting</h1>
	<script type="javascript">
		window.foo = bar;
	</script>
[end]

[python]
	class myLogger:
	    def __init__(self):
	        pass
	    def write(self,data):
	        file = open("mylog.txt","a")
	        file.write(data)
	        file.close()
[end]

Notes also supports inline snippets
	- like so [java] System.out.println("Hello!"); [end], see?
